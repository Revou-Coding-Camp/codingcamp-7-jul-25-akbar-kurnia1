# 📝 My To-Do List App

Hey there! Here's a to-do list app I put together. It was a mini-project for my **RevoU Coding Camp SE** class (the July 7, 2025 batch!). It's a pretty simple tool to help you keep track of your daily tasks, and it should look great on any device.

## Project Info

- **Course:** RevoU's SE Short Course
- **Assignment:** Make a To-Do List app
- **Deadline:** Saturday, 11:59 PM (WIB) - a classic weekend project!
- **Tools I used:** VS Code, Git, and Chrome

## ✨ What it can do

- **Add new tasks:** You can add tasks with a due date and time.
- **Mark things done:** Just click a task to cross it off your list.
- **Delete tasks:** Get rid of one task, or clear the whole list at once. (Don't worry, it'll ask you first!)
- **Filter your view:** Easily switch between seeing all your tasks, just the active ones, or the ones you've finished.
- **Sort your list:** Arrange your tasks by due date, name, or when you first created them.
- **It saves your work!:** Your tasks are saved right in the browser, so they'll be there when you come back.
- **Works anywhere:** Looks great on both computers and phones.

## 🚀 Tech I Used

- Good old HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (pulled from the CDN to keep things simple)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome for the icons

## 📂 Project Structure

.
├── index.html
└── js/
    └── script.js

**Note:** This project separates its JavaScript into the `js/` folder, which is a recommended practice. Custom CSS is placed inside `<style>` tags in `index.html` for simplicity, and Tailwind CSS is loaded from a CDN.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to run this on your own machine? It's pretty easy! Just follow these steps:

1.  **Clone this project**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Revou-Coding-Camp/codingcamp-7-jul-25-akbar-kurnia1.git](https://github.com/Revou-Coding-Camp/codingcamp-7-jul-25-akbar-kurnia1.git)
    ```
2.  **Go to the project folder**
    ```sh
    cd codingcamp-7-jul-25-akbar-kurnia1
    ```
3.  **Open the main file**
    Just open `index.html` in Chrome or your favorite browser. That's it!
